was all empty including the middle number.

The reason that I sent you the empty food box is..

108

Frankly, I do not really care about its actual meaning.

it was my own interpretation.

111

113
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,480

00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:58,302
Although it will take long, I will be patient and wait.

177
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,805
Waiting?

178
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,187
Waiting...

179
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,376
I...

180
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:07,945
I will govern the country using only knowledge and learning.

181
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,482
As for the force of army,

182
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:14,952
I will utilize it only to protect the country from invasion.

183
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,322
Hard shell of the force of army,

184
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:23,127
and the soft content of knowledge and learning

185
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:25,863
that is my Joseon.

186
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,667
The rule of right and the rule of might.

187
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,770
It is always a two-bladed sword.

188
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,975
My approach will be different.

189
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,076
Pursuading others through discussion and arguments.

190
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,269
Without making conclusions and being patient

191
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,547
and waiting...

192
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,583
Can't be...

193
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:49,954
Kyeongyeon (discussion with King) you're referring to.

194
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,823
Precisely so.

195
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:57,728
You say so because you do not know the aims to which Kyeongyeons were created under?

196
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,281
Yes...

197
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,666
They were established by the founding noblemen to contain King's power.

198
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,868
That's right.

199
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,937
To make a King a puppet,

200
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:13,143
with the excuse of that pretense to enlighten the King, is such that of Kyeongyeon.

201
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:16,480
However, you say you will put your sword down and do solely that?

202
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,581
Yes...

203
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,651
That is the beginning of Joseon reformation from Goryeo.

204
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:25,422
Joseon's politic and ideal of Neo-Confucianism.

205
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:30,294
Was Joseon established 100 or 200 year ago?

206
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,230
It has been 26 years.

207
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,832
Right.

208
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:37,635
It has been only 26 years.

209
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,103
If Joseon

210
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:42,406
will be sustained 50 years or 500 years.

211
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:45,509
No one knows yet.

212
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:48,345
Since no one dies with hunger in the city,

213
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:52,316
do you think it is a peaceful reign or something?

214
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:55,386
But...

215
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,955
wait and pursuade people?

216
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,390
But...

217
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,559
be patient?

218
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,827
But...

219
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,404
you are going to waste time on some discussion?

220
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:06,630
No it is not!

221
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,966
It is wasting!

222
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:12,770
You have to establish the foundations of the country and gather the will power.

223
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,940
And unite the strengths as one.

224
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,442
That is what the King of a 26-year-old nation has to do.

225
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:25,182
The position of a king of Joseon

226
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:30,487
is not that kind of relaxing position.

227
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:33,157
No.

228
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,513
Mil-bon [ hidden root ].

229
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:02,353
Have you ever heard of Mil-bon?

230
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,256
Yes...

231
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,759
Isn't that the rumor among the street gossipers?

232
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,562
There is a secret society of traitors called Mil-bon.

233
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:14,865
That is not just a rumour.

234
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,034
Father.

235
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:19,870
Do you possibly believe it?

236
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,741
Jeong Do Jeon, that man made Mil-Bon.

237
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:27,912
How should you believe in such idle talk of the town?

238
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:33,984
Jeong Do-Jeon's party are mostly killed or exiled. The survivors all lost their power.

239
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:37,121
Who can lead that kind of corps?

240
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,890
Isn't Jeong Gi-Joon still alive?

241
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,728
Year of Gichook (1409).

242
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:48,032
The protagonist of the Chodongyoseo.

243

Jeong Do-Jeon's nephew,

Jeong Gi Joon.

245
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:59,710
Aren't you thinking of this because of him?

246
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,948
Because of the incident that happened in year of Gi-Chook (the year of the Earth Ox - 1409),

247
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:09,286
that is why you aim to carry out Kyeongyeon or whatever it is, isn't it?

248
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,156
Aren't you saying all these?

249
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,760
Is it not right?

250
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,770
I...

251
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,174
don't remember who he was.

252
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:33,377

How is he?  I haven't seen anyone like him.

263

He bawls and squalls.

264
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:34,438
He is extremely stubborn at the age of only 12 years old or so.

265

I think we should starve him for a few days.

Impolite?

To become a leader,

303
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,738
the great treasure of an adult is authority and the great virtue on earth is life.

Although they look unwise,

322
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,311
they cannot be decieved with wisdom.

323

The king is...

324
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:12,182
the person who does that?

325
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,585
Is he the person who does not threaten people with power?

326
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:20,991
Ah... instead of threatening, he gives death.

Oh, all right.

331
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:30,967
He could do that as he is also a human.

332
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:35,405
Therefore, Sam Bong (Jeong Do-Jeon) established Kyeongyeon

333
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,741
to teach the king about Confucianism.

334

Also Sah-Gwan to restrict the king.

The six ministries and a leader to oversee as the head of the government.

336
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,749
He also made prime minister.

337

To make a virtuous king.

338
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,022
However,

339
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:54,824
the king holds Kyeongyeon

340
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:57,260
only a couple times per year?!

341
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,197
Intimidating the ministers.

342
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:05,002
This time, he made the prime minister a puppet.

343
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,605
He controls the 6 departments on his own.

344
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:11,074
However...

345
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,211
the reason I showed up at the examination is not that.

346
00:25:16,513 --> 00:25:17,848
Your father

347
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,316
killed my uncle.

348
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:23,253
It is not because he demolished everything that my uncle established!

349
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,122
If he demolished it,

350
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:31,127
it is right to withdraw the justice and writing that my uncle placed initially.

351
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:35,432
To tempt the scholars and noblemen who established Joseon,

352
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:37,601
being afraid of their leaving,

353
00:25:37,601 --> 00:25:41,738
he must not fake those principles!

354
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,640
That is the manner!

355
00:25:44,074 --> 00:25:45,542
That is...

356
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:51,114
the MANNER of the person who persues Confucianism at least a little bit!

357
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,352
Your Father..

358
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:58,989
stole Joseon from Sam-Bong.

359
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:01,791
He is a thief...

360
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:04,327
and a murderer!

361
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,277
There is nothing different from your father.

362
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:27,250
Only using violence.

363
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,399
Hurry up!

364
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:43,900
Quickly!

365
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:55,045
[ Jeong Do-Kwang, younger brother of Jeong Do-Jeon ]

366
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:57,982
Mencius said the people are the most precious. The king who protects...

367
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:01,084
Master! The fat is in the fire!

368
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,319
What's wrong?

369
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,454
Master, you have to run away!

370
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:05,489
You guys should run away too!

371
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,723
I asked you what happened!

372
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:08,392
Young master Gi-Joon went to take a royal exam.

373
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:09,359
What?

374
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,494
Regardless.

375
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,562
The army has almost arrived here.

376
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,030
Now, hurry.

377
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,716
Spare me, Sir.

378
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,308
Did Jeong Do-Kwang teach children in this town?

379
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:34,277
Yes, he did but...

380
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,646
Where is he?

381
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:39,349
Well, I don't know.

382
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,521
See?

383
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:47,290
Even a criticism from a young scholar,

384
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:50,861
your father pays it back as death.

385
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,530
That is the king of this country.

386
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,931
No.

387
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,000
Can't be.

388
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,203
He will not kill the people with that reason.

389
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:03,440
It must be a misunderstanding.

390
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,908
Misunderstanding?

391
00:29:06,443 --> 00:29:08,779
I will not ask twice.

392
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,947
Jeong Do-Kwang, and his son, Jeong Gi-Joon,

393
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,616
where are they?

394
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:15,218
I really don't know.

395
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,721
I will solve this problem.

396
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:39,142
Seeing you are holding me,

397
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:42,412
now you seem to know what your father is doing.

398
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:44,948
Also, you know that

399
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:47,751
you can't save anyone and

400
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,654
you can't do anything.

401
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,862
It's me!

402
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,599
I am Jeong Gi-Joon!

403
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,726
Get up.

404
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:34,731
Let me go!

405
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:36,166
I will go on my own!

406
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,834
Let me go!

407
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,657
<-----empty----->

408
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:18,908
Chase them! Chase them!

409
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:27,951
You cannot do anything!

410
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:36,426
Thats right, Jeong Gi-Joon.

411
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:40,197
Jeong Gi-Joon.

412
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,535
<i> Jeong Gi-Joon</i>

413
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:57,013
Jeong Gi-Joon...

414
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:01,000
Jeong Do-Kwang...

415
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,555
How did it go?

416
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,134
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:13,795
I lost him.

418
00:32:42,123 --> 00:32:44,199
Take away all the pots.

419
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,792
Huh?

420
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:31,307
A place like this in the house...

421
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,695
Your Majesty!

422
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,628
Here!

423
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:59,936
Read it!

424
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:01,605
Yes.

425
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:08,046
<i> If a king is a flower,</i>

426
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,248
<i> its root is a minister.</i>

427
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,749
<i> When its flower is not healthy,</i>

428
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:22,489
<i> the tree is not going to die but</i>

429
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:26,262
<i> when the root is not healthy, the tree will die.</i>

430
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:29,827
<i> The unhealthy flower...</i>

431
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:32,743
What are you doing? Read it!

432
00:34:34,771 --> 00:34:40,554
<i> can be just broken off.</i>

433
00:34:40,554 --> 00:34:41,808
Your Majesty!

434
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,513
This guy must be crazy!

435
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,709
Why don't you return, now?

436
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,383
Keep reading.

437
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,819
It's not worth reading!

438
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,187
Didn't I order you to read?

439
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,222
Your Majesty!

440
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:54,023
Get away!

441
00:34:57,694 --> 00:35:00,063
<i> The king only</i>

442
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,870
<i> decides the minister</i>

443

<i> and it is the position where he discusses things with the minister.</i>

444
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:09,686
<i> It is just the luxurious symbolic figure of Joseon.</i>

445
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:13,541
<i> The root of Joseon is the minister.</i>

446

Your Majesty!

447
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:17,381
<i> The noblemen of Joseon,</i>

448
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,716
<i> become the root!</i>

449
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:22,185
<i> Be the scholars sustaining Joseon,</i>

<i> As a result, the tree of Joseon can last for thousands of years.</i>

00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,260
<i> Be the root of the roots!</i>

<i> The hidden root.</i>

<i> Mil-Bon!</i>

458
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:56,820
<i> Why I made Mil-Bon.</i>

<i> Mil-Bon's first member, Jeong Do-Jeon.</i>

00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:15,939
Your Majesty!

465
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:18,141
He is already a dead man!

466
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:24,247
It is just the void daydreaming of a person who was once avid for the power.

467
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,312
Your Majesty!

468
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,641
This was it!

469
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,963
This was it...

470
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:33,990
What are you talking now, Your Majesty?

471
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,536
The thing he told me when he was dying.

472
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:41,066
Its meaning...

473
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,601
The flower is just the flower.

474
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,670
It cannot become the root or

475
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,739
get rid of the root.

476
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,275
You can't...

477
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,487
It is Mil-Bon...

478
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:56,880
Jeong Do-Jeon,

479
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,018
He made the secret corps.

480
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:12,695
Isn't it the sound of an owl?

481
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,940
Is Jo Mal-Saeng out there?

482
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:34,884
Why are you coming in?

483
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:36,315
Your Majesty.
[ Park Eun ]

484
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:40,495
Jo Mal-Saeng seems to have traced Jeong Gi-Joon and his father's movement.

485
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,459
Is that right?

486
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,232
Your Majesty!

487
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:53,036
Jo Mal-Saeng has been doing something suspicious.

488
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,005
Suspicious behaviour?

489
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:59,009
Without the royal command, was he moving the army of the Royal Investigation Bureau?

490
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,744
Yes!

491
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,581
However, Your Majesty!
[ Lee Shin Jeok ]

492
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:07,317
How were you aware of this already?

493
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:10,620
Jo Mal Saeng is moving under Grand King Former's secret command.

494
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,188
Secret command?

495
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:14,357
He's been looking for Jeong Gi-Joon and his father covertly.

496
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:15,410
Yes?

497
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:22,265
Find out where Jo Mal Saeng moved the army along.

498
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:24,868
Let me know, right away!

499
00:38:24,868 --> 00:38:26,303
Your Majesty, how come?

500
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,305
What are you doing?

501
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,574
There is no time to lose. No time.

502
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,376
Yes, Your Majesty!

503
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,930
Your Majesty,

504
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,051
what on earth are you trying to do?

505
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,821
Now, Moo Hyul it is your turn.

506
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,392
Is it true for sure?

507
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,097
Yes, Your Highness.

508
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:53,730
We received communication from those we've dispatched here and there.

509
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,231
It must be reliable.

510
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:57,600
Accordingly, did Jo Mal Saeng do something?

511
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,536
Yes, Your Highness.

512
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:38,208
<i>Subtitles brought to you by Deep Rooted Friends @ viki.com</i>

513
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,253
Over there! Chase after them!

514
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,838
From north to south village and high to low, we searched everywhere.

515
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:10,603
But we did not find them.

516
00:40:10,603 --> 00:40:12,743
Not there?

517
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,381
If they ran away riding horses, the sound must have been heard.

518
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,883
It is not possible they are not there.

519
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:22,018
Then...

520
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:25,588
They must have gotten off the horse and hidden somewhere.

521
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,762
North, South, High, Low.

522
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,197
If they were nowhere there,

523
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:36,967
then only one place is left!

524
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,871
It is Ban-Chon!

525
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,506
Do you mean Ban-Chon?

526
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,816
Ban-Chon?

527
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,552
Did they sneak into Ban-Chon?

528
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,853
Yes!

529
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:59,522
Therefore, the army is surrounding the Ban-Chon but

530
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:01,257
we cannot get in there without the Royal command.

531
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,827
I was told to come and receive the royal command at once.

532
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:05,362
But...

533
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:08,698
there are the shrines of Confucious and Moon Sun Gong.

534
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:11,735
We cannot allow the army to intrude there.

535
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:16,072
Isn't it just some custom made by the nobles?

536
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,514
Your Majesty...

537
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,843
Protecting Jeong Gi-Joon,

538
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:29,886
itself means the conflict with the former king.

539
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,456
A conflict...

540
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,624
A conflict...

541
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:35,559
Your Majesty!

542
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,029
That's right. It is a conflict...

543
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:42,232
He should not be alive in my father's Joseon.

544
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,900
In my Joseon,

545
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,703
and in my Jip-Hyun Jeon,

546
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:53,322
I need him, Jeong Gi-Joon.

547
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:56,913
Therefore, as long as you hear from them,

548
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:59,249
go right away,

549
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:02,352
bring Jeong Gi-Joon to me.

550
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:07,057
Capture and bring him to me!

551
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,892
However Your Majesty!

552
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:11,962
If the fact that the Royal army's intrusion to Ban-Chon was revealed,

553
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:15,365
the Confucian scholars won't just sit and watch.

554
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:18,101
We must capture him!

555
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:23,440
However, if the reason is due to him being the younger brother of Jeong Do Jeon,

556
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,209
those scholar's concern about Jeong Do-Jeon and his family...

557
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:29,579
You know very well about it.

558
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,916
I know! Since I know it,

559
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,218
Jeong Do Gwang.

560
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:37,320
Jeong Gi-Joon has to be

561
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,326
murdered secretly.

562
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:45,595
Jeong Do Gwang, perhaps not.

563
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:51,701
Jeong Gi-Joon will be a big trouble.

564
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:55,905
By fair means or foul, certainly this time,

565
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,908
you should capture those Jeongs.

566
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:00,343
But...

567
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:03,847
You should forward it to Jo Mal Saeng.

568
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:11,454
However, I did not allow him to intrude into Ban-Chon.

569
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,957
Yes, I understand that.

570
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,432
Minister...

571
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,334
Bring a group of soldiers

572
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:27,203
wait at the outside of Ban-Chon!

573
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:27,938
Yes,

574
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,241
I will do as you ordered.

575
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,620
<i>----</i>

576
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:47,802
Orabeoni (in dialect).

577
00:43:47,802 --> 00:43:48,984
You've come.

578
00:43:48,984 --> 00:43:50,594
You must be tired.

579
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:53,030
Shall we rest for awhile.

580
00:44:06,338 --> 00:44:08,445
Shit.

581
00:44:34,624 --> 00:44:37,839
AAAH shit. Crap.

582
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,552
This is exhausting.

583
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,998
Have you come?

584
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:39,636
<i>No suspicious movements?</i>

585
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,274
No.

586
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:05,662
What's wrong?

587
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,323
Did anything happen?

588
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:10,649
The king's men are under tight search.

589
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:14,305
When we went to drop off the message, we nearly suffered attack.

590
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,641
We were able to shake them off, but it's a worry.

591
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:22,079
Howevever, it is the shrine of Moon Sun Gong,

592
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,652
isn't it the safest place in Joseon?

593
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:26,046
It is true.. but

594
00:46:26,046 --> 00:46:29,250
Lee Bang Won will not care about those things.

595
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,191
Even so, without abandoning the Confucian scholars, he can't invade here.

596
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,934
Don't worry about it.

597
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:07,457
Until when do we have to do the rituals this way?

598
00:47:09,063 --> 00:47:13,761
I must pay back these grudges, Hyung Nim (older brother).

599
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:20,077
That day doesn't seem too far away.

600
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:25,175
Finally, I found it.

601
00:47:26,503 --> 00:47:28,745
What did you find?

602
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,451
Well..

603
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:36,052
Did you possibly?

604
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,281
Yes.

605
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,281
<i> Hyung-Nim!</i>

606
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,226
Hyung Nim!

607
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:36,285
Hyung Nim, finally we found the Mil-Bon letter.

608
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:44,481
The letter hand written by you, we finally found it.

609
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:24,489
It's done.

610
00:49:25,536 --> 00:49:28,183
Since we didn't have this Mil-Bon letter until now,

611
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:32,059
it was quite difficult to reestablish Mil-Bon.

612
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:40,279
However, now my brother is behind me.

613
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:44,319
I can establish Mil-Bon again!

614
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,717
Yes!

615
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:52,957
Now, you can become the 2nd chief of Mil-Bon.

616
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:58,878
Teacher Sam-Bong is with you!

617
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:04,835
All Confucian scholars will follow you.

618
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,439
Did His Highness Grand King Former, really command that way?

619
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:29,900
Yes!

620
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,062
I got it!

621
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,757
How did it go?

622
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,724
They seemed to sneak into Moon Sung Gong's shrine.

623
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:48,881
That shrine?

624
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,555
Intrude into Moon Sung Gong's shrine.

625
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,663
Also, from now on, we are not the Royal army.

626
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:23,852
Do you get it?

627
00:51:23,852 --> 00:51:25,465
Yes!

628
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:29,302
You have to act as fast and secretly as possible.

629
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:35,242
If anyone of you get caught, the prosecutor's department will deny any relations.

630
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:39,919
We will not be responsible for anything for you. You will die as a traitor.

631
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:46,585
You must succeed as fast and secretly as possible without any dropout!

632
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:47,621
Do you understand?

633
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:49,289
Yes!

634
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:54,561
Take off your uniforms and wear black clothing with a mask on.

635
00:51:55,562 --> 00:52:00,133
Your Majesty, Dongbu Dae-eon (Royal Messenger) is coming in.

636
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,424
Where are they?

637
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,259
They are in Ban-Chon.

638
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,603
Ban-Chon?

639
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:11,662
Yes...

640
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:16,166
Did possibly my father allow the army to intrude into Ban-Chon?

641
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,502
I do not know if he allowed it in person.

642
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,271
Jo Mal Saeng's men are around Ban-Chon.

643
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:26,160
Lord Park Eun also is heading toward the outside of Ban-Chon.

644
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,581
We are already late.

645
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,753
Now, all we have is you.

646
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,122
Go ahead. Now!

647
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,880
Your Majesty! Are you sure?

648
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,861
You have to save Jeong Do-Gwang and Jeong Gi-Joon!

649
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:48,098
Unquestioningly, you must bring them alive!
Do you get it?

650
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,405
I will follow your command!

651
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,461
Where?

652
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,980
Aww, why can't I reach it?

653
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:18,249
Where is it?

654
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:22,349
Where is it?

655
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:30,719
A bit...a bit more...

656
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,264

00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,501
Catch the brat!

676
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:24,604
Catch him!

677
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:45,192
Hurry and catch him.

678
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,530
Hey, this way!

679
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,764
Jang Seung forest...

680
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,134
Isnt' the crazy boy going into the shrine?

681
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:56,403
Block him!

682
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:27,033
How are Gi-Joon and Pyung doing?

683
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:32,739
Yes, they stay secretly at a place where no one knows about.

684
00:57:04,405 --> 00:57:06,440
Just a kid.

685
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:12,446
<-----empty----->

686
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,388
Not just one punk.

687
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,459
Why you little cow.

688
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:28,829
It seems that they are on the same side.

689
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,237
Who are you?

690
00:57:37,237 --> 00:57:39,840
Who are you?

691
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,120
Get away from here.

692
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,322
Assasins are here.

693
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:58,425
This way.

694
00:58:01,462 --> 00:58:05,532
If you go this way, it connects to Jang Seung forest.

695
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,437
Master!

696
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:21,448
I asked you who the heck you are?

697
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:27,387
What is this commotion?

698
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:30,957
Who are you, you guys?

699
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:34,461
Don't you know where this is?

700
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:36,864
This place is the shrine

701
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:39,032
for Moon Sung Gong who introduced Confucianism to this land!

702
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:43,036
Even the Royal army cannot come in here because of this place.

703
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:45,906
How dare you slash swords here?

704
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:48,275
Who the heck are you?

705
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:53,780
Attack!

706
00:58:55,382 --> 00:58:57,651
Beat them up!

707
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:28,348
Ggeut Soo!

708
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,121
Elder.

709
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:11,759
Hurry, hurry up!

710
01:00:11,759 --> 01:00:13,894
You brat!

711
01:00:25,572 --> 01:00:28,575
Master!

712
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:36,817
This way!

713
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:51,131
To the north of Ban-Chon, two horses are leaving rapidly.

714
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:52,966
Move out at once.

715
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:54,634
Let's go.

716
01:01:23,364 --> 01:01:25,132
Take charge of this place!

717
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:27,768
I will chase after Jeong Do Gwang.

718
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,815
Wait in ambush over there.

719
01:01:41,815 --> 01:01:43,950
Yes, Sir.

720
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:48,588
To the left, into the mountain.

721
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,170
Stop there! Stop!

722
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:06,006
What's wrong?

723
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:08,241
Mil-Bon letter!

724
01:02:09,743 --> 01:02:12,779
The horse that he rode away carries the Mil-Bon letter!

725
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:27,727
Oh the pouch!

726
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,765
Father's last will.

727
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,201
The pouch!

728
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:37,104
I have been looking for the past 20 years.

729
01:02:37,104 --> 01:02:39,539
I can't leave without it!

730
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:42,309
I will look for it!

731
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:47,047
Master, please get away from this area!

732
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:58,225
Master! Master!

733
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:03,297
We have to find it! Mil-Bon letter!

734
01:03:03,297 --> 01:03:06,066
First, you have to get away from here.

735
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,976
Stop! I have to find it!

736
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:17,678
My father's last will.

737
01:03:17,678 --> 01:03:21,648
I have to return! Stop! Stop!

738
01:03:21,648 --> 01:03:24,418
Please, stop!

739
01:03:36,497 --> 01:03:38,532
Go back, go back.

740
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:41,501
I told you to go back. Hey!

741
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,470
Go back!

742
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,540
Please, go back!

743
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,842
Ah damn it!

744
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,804
Troops from the Royal Investigation Bureau are dispatched on both sides of the forest.

745
01:04:16,804 --> 01:04:20,340
At least 100 heads of army on east and north.

746
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,508
It's this way.

747
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:22,376
What is that sound?

748
01:04:22,376 --> 01:04:25,646
Over there, Lord Jo Mal Saeng is chasing someone.

749
01:04:25,646 --> 01:04:27,414
I got it.

750
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,785
Let's go!

751
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:38,725
<i>We have to find</i>

752
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:40,994
<i> the Mil-Bon letter.</i>

753
01:04:42,363 --> 01:04:45,432
<i> You must capture them!</i>

754
01:04:47,568 --> 01:04:48,736
<i> I have to find</i>

755
01:04:48,736 --> 01:04:50,971
<i> my father's last will.</i>

756
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:54,708
<i> Surely,</i>

757
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,043
<i> save them!</i>
